# Plant IoT Monitoring System
Final project of Embedded platforms and communications for IoT course. MSc IoT UPM 2021.

## Objectives
The main goal of this project is to develop an IoT system allowing environmental conditions and the health 
of a plant throughout its life. For example, this will enable vendors to adjust the final price of unique plants, 
like bonsais or very delicate plants, for which the environmental conditions they have suffered throughout 
their lives are crucial. The system could also be useful as a monitoring system in greenhouses by monitoring 
several plants randomly.
