# EPC - Plant Monitoring IoT System 

You can build the project with all supported [Mbed OS build tools](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/tools/index.html). However, this example project specifically refers to the command-line interface tool [Arm Mbed CLI](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-cli#installing-mbed-cli).
(Note: To see a rendered example you can import into the Arm Online Compiler, please see our [import quick start](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/online-with-the-online-compiler.html#importing-the-code).)

## Mbed OS build tools

### Mbed CLI 2
Starting with version 6.5, Mbed OS uses Mbed CLI 2. It uses Ninja as a build system, and CMake to generate the build environment and manage the build process in a compiler-independent manner. If you are working with Mbed OS version prior to 6.5 then check the section [Mbed CLI 1](#mbed-cli-1).
1. [Install Mbed CLI 2](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/build-tools/install-or-upgrade.html).
1. From the command-line, import the example: `mbed-tools import mbed-os-example-blinky`
1. Change the current directory to where the project was imported.

### Mbed CLI 1
1. [Install Mbed CLI 1](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/latest/quick-start/offline-with-mbed-cli.html).
1. From the command-line, import the example: `mbed import mbed-os-example-blinky`
1. Change the current directory to where the project was imported.
